 [Features]
 - The warning diagnostic call that triggers when plugins call
   '_share_dir_map' from register_plugins  has been special-cased with a
   white-list so that no errors are produced for the MakeMaker plugin and
   everything else will Carp fatally. Hopefully this doesn't prove a
   problem for anyone.

 - Permit MakeMaker to call zilla->_share_dir_map on our shadow-zilla
   during pre-req collection. It should preferably be avoided, but this is
   needed for now to make it work. ( Reported by Apocalypse on IRC ).

0.01000515 2010-11-08T17:06:39Z
 - Depend on newer Test::Simple because subtest() can work wrong without
   it.
 - Depend on newer Util::Test::KENTNL

0.01000101 2010-11-04T03:15:07Z
 - Added shadow_zilla and ->find_files to prereqcollector so that
   AutoPrereq works.

 - Added get_prereqs to access prereq data and regenerate it whenever you
