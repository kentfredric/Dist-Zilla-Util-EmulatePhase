 [Bugfix]
 - Handle some odd cases that turn up when you're working with scary deep
   nested code.
 - Handle having a faked zilla passed down to us instead of a real zilla (
   ie: when another emulate::phase instance is triggering code triggering
   emulate phase )
 - Prereq collector now has a plugins() method that returns an empty array
   ref.
 - Can now actually bootstrap if deps are updated.

 [Features]
 - The warning diagnostic call that triggers when plugins call
   '_share_dir_map' from register_plugins  has been special-cased with a
   white-list so that no errors are produced for the MakeMaker plugin and
   everything else will Carp fatally. Hopefully this doesn't prove a
   problem for anyone.

0.01003312 2010-12-05T14:48:13Z
 - Permit MakeMaker to call zilla->_share_dir_map on our shadow-zilla
   during pre-req collection. It should preferably be avoided, but this is
   needed for now to make it work. ( Reported by Apocalypse on IRC ).

0.01000515 2010-11-08T17:06:39Z

   it.
